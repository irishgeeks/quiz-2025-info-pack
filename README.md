# Irish Techie Table Quiz 2025

This is an information pack about Irish Techie Table Quiz 2025.

# 🎄 It’s beginning to look a lot like… quizmas!

​We’re delighted to share and welcome back a beloved tech community tradition in collaboration and hosted by [Dogpatch Labs](https://dogpatchlabs.com), the **2025 Tech Community Table Quiz**, organised by long-time champions [Declan McGrath](https://www.linkedin.com/in/declanmcgrath/), [Michael Twomey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mick-twomey-engineer/) and [Vicky Twomey-Lee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vickyleeire/) ([Irish Geeks](https://irishgeeks.github.io)).

​Even better, this event will be in aid of the [Dublin Simon Community](https://www.dubsimon.ie), with all proceeds going directly to those who need it this winter season.

​What began as a grassroots gathering has become a festive favourite — bringing together developers, designers, founders, and enthusiasts for an evening of light-hearted trivia, friendly rivalry, and charitable giving. We’re excited to keep the tradition thriving by joining us as Dogpatch Labs open up their Urban Garden for a special Christmas edition.

​Dust off your cheesiest Christmas jumper, gather your sharpest teammates, and get ready for a fun, festive night of community and connection.

Last year we raised over €1,600 from contributions by the Irish tech community and friends, which went up to over €2,800 with match-funding from Workday (host). You can read about last year's quiz and other past quizzes here: https://irishgeeks.github.io
